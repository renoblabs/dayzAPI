draft readme for dayZ token transfer API Service

You’re basically holding a trusted, one-time handoff mechanism between the game and an external brain (Mongo/Postgres). That means anything that benefits from atomic, one-time, cross-context actions is fair game.

1.	Mint a token (with some JSON payload).
	2.	Hand it off (player, Discord bot, web app — doesn’t matter).
	3.	Burn/Claim the token once and only once.
	4.	Return the payload to the claimer.

Everything else (server hopping, NPC shops, faction wars, beer-can banks) is just how you decide to fill and interpret that payload.

🏒 Example payloads you could stuff inside

Cross-server move

{
  "steamId": "76561198000000000",
  "gear": ["HockeyStick", "BeerCan", "Jersey_Red"],
  "health": 85,
  "pos": [7500, 300, 7500]
}

NPC shop receipt

{
  "steamId": "76561198000000000",
  "item": "GoalieMask_Gold",
  "cost": 25,
  "currency": "beer_can"
}

Faction point

{
  "faction": "Red Goons",
  "points": 10,
  "event": "GoalieFightNight"
}

Bet escrow

{
  "matchId": "GFN-2025-09-06-01",
  "stake": 5,
  "currency": "beer_can",
  "players": ["steamId1", "steamId2"]
}

⚡ Why it’s powerful
	•	Atomic → once claimed, it’s gone. No dupes.
	•	Portable → can be handed across servers, apps, or even Discord.
	•	Flexible → payload can be as simple as { item: bandage } or as fat as an entire inventory.

The server switching use case is just the “airport baggage check” demo. The clever shit happens when you realize the same flow can handle currencies, events, wagers, and progression.

Here’s a list of actually workable, clever spins:

⸻

🎭 1. “Event Tickets”
	•	Issue a token to a player that’s not for server switching but for entry into a special event.
	•	Example: /transfer creates a “Goalie Fight Night” entry token.
	•	Only claimable once during that event → prevents freeloaders or repeat entry.
	•	Tie it to cosmetics or event rewards (claim = receive a Golden Mask).

⸻

🔄 2. Cross-character progression
	•	Imagine you’ve got multiple themed servers (e.g., Hockey Apocalypse, Zombie Island, Wrestling Arena).
	•	Tokens carry meta-progression: kill count, currency, perks.
	•	A player finishes a match in Arena → claims token on Apocalypse → spawns with faction reputation or a bonus.
	•	It turns your servers into a linked league, not isolated islands.

⸻

🏦 3. Secure trading / vending
	•	Tokens can act like receipts.
	•	Player buys an item from a Discord shop or web UI → API issues a token for that item.
	•	They claim it in-game via NPC vendor → gets the goods, token burned.
	•	Stops dupes because the token is atomic + one-use.

⸻

🥊 4. Wager matches
	•	Before a duel (1v1 in the rink), both players “stake” currency via the API.
	•	API issues a shared fight token.
	•	Winner claims it in-game → API pays out the pooled beer-can credits.
	•	Prevents welchers because the bet is escrowed outside the server.

⸻

🌍 5. Global faction wars
	•	Every kill or event generates a “point token” that gets claimed by the API.
	•	Claimed tokens add to a global scoreboard (Mongo = single source of truth).
	•	End of week → whichever faction has most claims wins a server-wide buff, custom spawns, or bragging rights.

⸻

🎰 6. External minigames → in-game loot
	•	Run a Discord trivia bot, web arcade, or even a hockey shootout mini-game.
	•	Winners get a token (via API).
	•	Claimable in-game = supply drop, special cosmetic, or faction points.
	•	Suddenly the server’s sticky across multiple platforms.

⸻

🕵️ 7. Anti-cheat / sanity checks
	•	Server can require a valid token before certain high-value spawns (e.g., rare loot crate).
	•	Prevents people from spamming console commands or spoofing.
	•	You can issue tokens with a very short TTL so only trusted scripted paths can mint loot.

⸻

🏒 8. Rotating world events
	•	Spawn a “travel token” to a secret map shard or instanced arena (e.g., Winter Classic Rink).
	•	Only valid for 20 minutes.
	•	Claim moves you into that instanced event or unlocks NPCs for that short time.
	•	Creates FOMO and appointment play.

⸻

⚡ Straight talk

The beauty is tokens are just one-time JSON receipts. You can:
	•	Mint them anywhere (in-game, Discord, web).
	•	Burn them anywhere (any server that trusts the API).
	•	Guarantee atomicity (no dupes, no race conditions).

That makes them perfect for cross-server trust, external integrations, and scarcity-based mechanics.
